(Questions from Patrick Barclay)


1.  Thanks for sending us that link. I can get in and see what files are there, but I can't open the ones I think it is because they're .dta files. (The the other files don't seem to have data... perhaps I'm mistaken about which files have the data?) What program do you use to open the .dta files? I think they're STATA files... can they be opened with other programs, and if not, are the data in any form other than .dta files?

- A: Yes, these are stata files.  there are various tools for converting between formats, such as Stat/Transfer.  if I have time I could also export these as
 .csv  files, but  things are very busy at the moment.


1. We might be able to get effect sizes for stakes from your regressions on p11 of the main paper (in the "paper plus" folder). However, let me just confirm something about the methods: it sounds like these stakes were not randomly assigned, but instead were earned, with the participants who solved the most sums receiving the highest endowments. Have I understood this correctly?

- A: there were two treatments along this dimension;  performance versus random.   In the performance treatment  payment depended on your rank in  terms of how many you solved.  In the random treatment your payment was determined randomly ( with the same distribution as in the performance treatment).  Participants did the same sums task in both treatments, but in the random treatment it had no implication for payoffs.

1. If so, we might not be able to include this in our meta-analysis, because stake size is confounded with participants' math ability. (We wouldn't know whether any (lack of) effect of stakes is due to the higher stakes themselves or due to the fact that the participants who received the highest stakes were the ones who had solved the most math problems. Or there may be an effect of stakes which is countered by an opposing effect of math ability, resulting in an overall no difference donations between 5, 7.5, \& 10 Euros. )

- I understand your concern. You could limit your analysis to those in the random treatment.  As we observe performance scores (number of tasks) in both treatments, you could also methods of controlling for the performance score  in your estimation,  and these should be valid so long as relative performance in the uncompensated task reflects performance in the compensated task.

 I believe that we did not find any relationship between performance in the uncompensated task and donations, but  we may not have had a large enough sample size to detect a reasonable sized difference.
