%Similarity data: quick stories

*Data input in ../inputbasicclean.do

(note, 8 observations missing because I was lazy and used cheap demo version of Stattransfer)

*ran a Prolific experiment/survey over the weekend involving charitable giving, working with Giving for Impact (Netherlands). This is not the survey we have been discussing but I think the results are also informative for our discussion
*I recruited a fairly general UK nonstudent pool, and the description did not emphasize charity, so it should not have particularly attracted altruists.

#Actual donations

##Choice where to donate Â£10 if win (they had a 1/20 chance of winning); donations matched at 25% rate

*Note: results are very similar if we remove the 8 entries started before the verification fix ('if afterfix')
