\begin_layout Title
Decomposing Desert and Tangibility Effects in a Charitable Giving Experiment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
David Reinstein and Gerhard Riener
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Several papers have documented that when subjects play with standard laboratory
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

endowments
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 they make less self-interested choices than when they use money they have
 either earned through a laboratory task or brought from outside the lab.
 In the context of a charitable giving experiment we decompose this into
 two common artifacts of the laboratory: the intangibility of money (or
 experimental currency units) promised on a computer screen relative to
 cash in hand, and the distinct treatment of random 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

windfall
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 gains relative to earned money.
 While both effects are found to be significant in non-parametric tests,
 the former effect, which has been neglected in previous studies, has a
 stronger impact on total donations, while the latter effect has a greater
 impact on the probability of donating.
 These results have clear implications for experimental design, and also
 suggest that the availability of more abstract payment methods may increase
 other-regarding behavior in the field.

In all of the experiments mentioned above the dictator subjects'

 come from answering GMAT questions, some of which involve retailers' and

 These may be triggering more self-interested behavior through a framing

 However, the estimated relationships between the dictators' gifts and the

This literature has ignored a second component of the bias that may limit
 the external validity of many laboratory results: people may treat money
 they are promised (or are given in the form of tokens) differently then
 cash they physically hold -- we call this the 
\emph on
tangibility 
\emph default
effect We hypothesize three potential reasons why this may occur.
 First, psychology experiments demonstrate that subjects given 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

reminders of money
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 are both less helpful and less likely to ask for help in a variety of non-remun

Second, using cash may cause subjects to more carefully consider the consumption
 they are sacrificing.
 Along similar lines, 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
citet{Oberholzer-Gee1999}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 argue that subjects do not fully consider the opportunity costs of the
 funds they give away in experiments, and 
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
citet{Mazar2008}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 find that people cheat more when using exchangeable tokens then when they
 use cash.
 Finally, parting with cash may itself bring some disutility, perhaps through
 an attachment to this money similar to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

citet{kahneman1991anomalies}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 For all of these reasons, we might therefore expect that subjects holding
 cash will be less likely to contribute this to a public good or a charitable
 cause.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To the best of our knowledge, there is no economic evidence on the effect
 of the medium of exchange on generosity.
 However, at least one prominent experiment varies this in conjunction with
 other variations in the treatment, leading to a potential confound.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
E.g., in 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

 the "single blind 2" treatment combines both a decreased social distance
 from the experimenter (relative to "single blind 1") and "a decision form
 for making the decision, instead of money".
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In the present paper we implement a real charitable giving experiment to
 provide the first salient economic evidence that the tangibility of the
 choice medium affects other-regarding decisions.

Experimental design
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use a charitable giving experiment with a 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times2$
\end_inset

 design to differentiate two distinct artifacts of laboratory endowments.
 Firstly, the treatments vary according to the extent to which subjects
 should see the money as 
\shape italic
earned
\shape default
; we compare giving behavior after compensation based on performance on
 a five minute task to behavior with a randomly assigned payment.
 The second dimension of variation involves the tangibility of the payment:
 we either give cash to the subjects 
\shape italic
before
\shape default
 they decide how much to donate (and they physically place any donations
 they make into envelopes) or they allocate their donation from an endowment
 on the computer screen and they are paid cash at the end of the experiment.
 Thus, we separately test whether 
\emph on
earning the money
\emph default
 and having 
\emph on
cash in hand
\emph default
 affect giving behavior in the lab.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In addition to the treatments mentioned above, we also vary the choice set.
 As a robustness check, we offer three charities instead of two in the 
\emph on
expanded choice set
\emph default
 treatment.
 This allows us to demonstrate that our results are not sensitive to a variation
 in the choice set.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike many of the experiments previously mentioned, our subjects make decisions
 over donations to charitable foundations -- institutions outside the laboratory.
 In line with 
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
citet{Eckel1996}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, we see this as a more obvious and typical expression of other-regarding
 behavior than donations to a laboratory public good or towards another
 laboratory subject.
 Our environment also provides a more demanding test for tangibility and
 windfall effects.
 In the real world it is rare to be asked for a gift from a random non-needy
 stranger (or to receive such a gift); hence, it is not surprising that
 standard dictator games should be sensitive to framing effects.
 On the other hand charitable appeals and charitable giving are regularities,
 so subjects will have more experience with such decisions and their decisions
 should be less easily perturbed.
 While dictator giving to other subjects is highly sensitive to the level
 of social isolation, falling to very low levels in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

double-blind
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 environments 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 conditions 
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
citep{Eckel1996}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Our setting may also better isolate the effect of asset legitimacy: intuition
 suggests that in the charitable giving context, subjects will focus less
 on their desert 
\emph on
relative
\emph default
 to the recipient(s) then they would in deciding how much to give to a fellow
 subject.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All treatments are assigned orthogonally; we have a (nearly) fully balanced
 design.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Because the treatments were run in separate sessions and their were some
 no-shows, the actual observations are very slightly off-balance, and the
 endowments are not precisely identically distributed by treatment, nor
 is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

choice set
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 treatment.
 However, these slight differences are controlled for in our multivariate
 regressions and in our balanced bootstrapped rank-sum tests.
 The lack of balance does not measurably affect any of our results.
 Our treatments are also not perfectly balanced over time.
 To test for session-specific effects, in online Appendix 5 Table 5 we also
 report regressions with standard errors clustered by session, and controls
 for time-of-day and date of session effects; our results are robust to
 all of these, and none of these are significant.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 By construction, the distribution of initial endowments is the same for
 each treatment.
 Finally, all of our treatments involve the same strong level of anonymity.

To guarantee anonymity, the lab was divided into an outer partition - which
 serves as a meeting room before the experiment and as a room for the administra
tors during the experiment - and an inner partition with computer terminals
 on which the subjects make decisions and answer questions.
 These were separated so that it was impossible to see the inner partition
 from the the outer partition and vice-versa.
 For administrative purposes, a volunteer from the participants helped with
 the procedures whenever communication between the inner and the outer part
 of the lab was necessary.
 Furthermore, to ensure our credibility, this volunteer supervised the online
 donations made by the experimenters after the other participants had been
 dismissed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the beginning of the experiment all subjects were assured that we would
 not be able to connect their name to the decisions they made.
 Next we asked for a volunteer to help us with administrative issues, mainly
 allocating the sealed envelopes with payouts at the end of the experiment.

\begin_layout Standard
The participants were given five minutes to solve as many tasks as possible.
 We argue that this task was sufficiently tedious to make subjects feel
 that they 
\emph on
earned
\emph default
 the money recieved.
 This task, although numerical, is less likely to cue self-interested

 thinking than the GMAT questions used in many previous studies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
The charitable giving stage (donation decision)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The subjects were not given any indication that this experiment would involve
 an opportunity for charitable giving until they reached the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

charitable giving stage
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This stage was a one-shot dictator game in which subjects could donate
 none, some, or all of their endowment to any combination of the available
 charities in units of 50 Euro cents.
 All subjects were presented 
\shape italic
\emph on
with
\emph default
 Brot für die Welt
\shape default
 (BfdW) -- 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bread for the World
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, a German development aid agency and the World Wild Life Fund for Nature
 (WWF), a nature conservancy charity.
 For the 
\emph on
expanded choice set 
\emph default
treatment 
\shape italic
\emph on
we
\emph default
 
\emph on
also included 
\emph default
Deutsches Rotes Kreuz
\shape default
 (DRK) - the German Red Cross - which operates in similar areas as 
\shape italic
BfdW
\shape default
.
 Subjects were given information about each of the charities on the computer
 screen and next had to decide how much (if anything) to donate to each
 available charity and enter this into the computer.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The order of the presentation of the charities, both on the description
 screens and on the actual donation screen are stratified over subjects,
 in order to balance any potential order effects.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 By using multiple charities we reduced the noise surrounding heterogeneous
 tastes for charities, and gained more useful data on a wider range of subjects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Treatment 1: Performance / (on-screen) Account (PA)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Subjects in the performance treatments were told that the probability of
 higher earnings increased in the number of tasks correctly completed, but
 we did not specify exactly how performance translated into payoffs.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We did not tell them that their pay was based on 
\shape italic
relative
\shape default
 performance.
 They were instead told that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the more sums you solve, the more likely it is that you will get a higher
 payment
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (in German: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
Je mehr Aufgaben Sie lösen desto wahrscheinlicher ist es, dass sie mehr
 verdienen
\emph default
.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), because we did not want them to compare themselves to other subjects
 in making their charitable contributions.
 Such a comparison might have lead them to believe that that subjects who
 earned more had a greater obligation to donate.
 In the treatments of October 2008, the subject who solved the most sums
 received ¤10, the second ¤7.50 and the rest of the subjects in the same
 session got ¤5.
 In the sessions conducted in February, March, and September 2009, the participa
nts who were in the upper tercile of solved tasks received ¤10, in the middle
 tercile ¤7.50 and in the lower tercile ¤5.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 After completing the task they were told how much this earned them.
 In 
\emph on
account
\emph default
 treatments they were endowed ¤5, ¤7.50 or ¤10 (shown on their computer screen)
 but were not yet given cash
\emph on
.
 
\emph default
They next made their donation decisions.
 At the end of the experiment they were (anonymously) given envelopes containing
 their earnings minus their total donations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Treatment 2: Performance / Cash (PC)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As in 
\emph on
PA
\emph default
, subjects first completed the task and learned how much they earned.
 However, unlike in the 
\emph on
account 
\emph default
treatments, subjects in
\emph on
 cash 
\emph default
treatments were paid in cash 
\emph on
before 
\emph default
they made giving decisions.
 After the task stage, the volunteer was prompted to come outside and bring
 the numbered envelopes containing the cash earnings into the inner part
 , where they hand each subject the envelope with his or her subject number
 on it.
 The payment envelopes were carefully assembled to look identical and have
 similar weights.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We did this by using coins of different increments.
 To the extent that small coins are less desirable then bills this would
 lead to a bias 
\emph on
against
\emph default
 our finding of a tangibility effect.
 Since payments in performance and random treatments had the same distribution,
 this should not impact our 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

earnings effect
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 findings.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Subjects were instructed to inspect and count the money in private at their
 computer desks.
 Next, they made their donation decision(s) by entering these choices on
 the computer screen.
 Finally, subjects were asked to put the chosen contributions (in cash)
 into the donation envelope and seal it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Treatment 3: Random / on screen Account (RA)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this treatment, subjects were
\emph on
 
\emph default
endowed
\emph on
 
\emph default
¤5, ¤7.50 or ¤10 randomly on their computer screen.
 The donation stage followed, and payments were distributed as in 
\emph on
PA
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Treatment 4: Random / Cash (RC)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the 
\emph on
RC 
\emph default
treatment the endowments were randomly determined (as in 
\emph on
RA
\emph default
), and given to the subjects in identical envelopes as in 
\emph on

 The donation and payments procedure also followed

 Subjects donated significantly less

\begin_layout Plain Layout
These differences are significant in Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, as well as
 in familiar parametric tests (available by request).
 Because of the aforementioned lack of balance (stemming from no-shows),
 we also report bootstrapped rank-sum tests in brackets, with each of the
 1000 random draws (with replacement) exactly balanced by payment treatment,
 earnings treatment, choice set treatment, and stake size.

 shows the cumulative distribution of the share of earnings donated over
 the earnings and payment treatments.
 The distribution of contributions under on-screen entitlements (RA and
 PA) stochastically dominates the distribution under cash payments (RC and
 PC).
 Similarly, the distribution under random payments (RA and RC) stochastically
 dominates the distribution under performance-based earnings (PA and PC).

On the other hand, as Table

 demonstrates, the performance treatment has a stronger extensive margin
 effect; subjects are significantly less likely to donate at all if they
 have earned their endowment through their performance.
 To give an intuitive spin, some people may feel more comfortable keeping
 all of their money if they think they have earned it and thus deserve it,
 while those who do feel compelled to donate find that giving away cash
 feels more

 in terms of sacrificed consumption than giving away money on a computer
 screen.
 This result is confirmed by our Probit regressions with controls for endowment
 size, gender, and the larger choice set (see Appendix 4).

We use a standard OLS specification for familiarity and comparability reasons.
 We also use a Poisson specification, both because our data resembles count
 data (in increments of 50 cents) and because this specification deals with
 corner-solution (non-negative) data without being as sensitive to non-normality
 and heteroskedasticity as a standard Tobit regression

 In online Appendix 5 (table 5) we find similar results using a fractional
 regression specification.
 The cash and performance results are similar in zero-inflated Poisson regressio
ns (available by request).

 These regressions (Table

) again suggest that cash treatments reduced generosity.
 The effect of cash is negative and significant in the Account treatments,
 and negative but insignificant in Performance treatments (summed coefficient:

 Donations were also lower when subjects were paid according to their performanc
e, but this effect was not statistically significant here.
 The coefficients on higher stake sizes (¤7.5 or ¤10) are small and not significa
nt: subjects who earn more do not tend to donate more.
 In line with some previous work, (e.g.,

 Total donations were not significantly different when a third charity was
 included.
 The interaction effects are not significant, although their positive sign
 and magnitude suggest that the treatments have a sub-additive effect --
 the summed coefficient (

Conclusion 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our experiment is the first to document the tangibility effect; its magnitude
 appears at least as strong as the windfall effect, although the latter
 has a stronger effect at the extensive margin.
 Furthermore, by using a charitable giving context and a relatively neutral
 real-effort task, we add to the evidence that the legitimacy (
\emph on
absolute 
\emph default
desert) of experimental subjects' 
\emph on
own 
\emph default
assets affects their other-regarding behavior.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our findings do not imply that experimenters should 
\emph on
always
\emph default
 use

\end_inset

tangible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cash.
 In the context of our experiment, we cannot say which contribution level
 is more externally valid.
 Whether the differences are because seeing money cues self-interest, because
 cash causes a more careful consideration of trade-offs, or because parting
 with cash is more painful, either frame (cash or endowment) may have external
 validity.

On the one hand, cash is obviously better if it leads to greater experimenter
 credibility.
 However, this is unlikely to have been a driver of our results, as all
 of our subjects had previously participated in economic experiments.
 On the other hand, cash may lead to other extraneous effects; e.g., it may
 cue subjects to consider the nuisance carrying around earnings that include

 In the field many decisions are made without physical cash, as credit cards
 and electronic payments have become dominant in many markets.
 However, researchers must be

 of this framing effect and take it into account.
 This distinction is important: economic experiments vary greatly along
 both dimensions, often simultaneously.

 require experimental examination to identify what is driving the outcome;
 an envelope containing the cash might be an important factor." Our analysis
 confirms this speculation.
